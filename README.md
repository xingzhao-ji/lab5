# Hey! I'm Filing Here

In this lab, I successfully implemented a 1 MiB ext2 filesystem with 2 directories, 1 regular file, and 1 symbolic link.

## Building
Run this command in the same directory where the Makefile is located to build:
```shell
make
```

## Running
```shell
```


## Cleaning up
To clean up and remove the executables created, use this command:
```shell
make clean
```
